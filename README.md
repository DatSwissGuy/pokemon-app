# Installing / Running the App

Clone the repo. Then run `npm install` to install dependencies, after that run `ng serve` to serve the app. 

Alternatively if you have Docker, run `docker-compose up --build` to build and then serve the app on ` localhost:4000`.

# WIPs

This list is in no particular order / respectively prioritized.

- This readme needs some work üòÖ
