# Screenshots / Progress
![Progress-2020-9-13](doc/Screenshot_2020-12-08.png)
*Initial design / layout for the app, showing the first 151 Pok√©mon*

- A list of Pok√©mon from each generation can be selected (19.01.2021)
- Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions

# Demo

Can be found [here](https://pokemon-app-51156.web.app)

# WIPs

- This readme needs some work üòÖ
- The Docker Compose build action is still a work in progress. The badge only shows that the build was successful. No information regarding tests.
- A list of all games with their artwork
- Tests for CD / CI
- Additional info for each Pok√©mon (abilities, appearances, stats etc.) 

# Additional Info

I pushed directly into master in order to learn how to setup GitHub actions, that's something that should be avoided at all cost. For me this was quite a challenge to make the automatic deployment work.
